## Lyrics

```
[CHORUS]
I'm sick and tired of this giving you my place
Remember when I made you promise
to deflower better days of yours, it's my space 
it's my space bitch, it's my space

[VERSE]
know i'm gonna clear it see the reaper in my face 
you so fearful of the freedom of decisions they a maze

fallen patterns tread in errant sinage
fucking furious conduits of violence
hide it hide it bitch

you ain't right you ain't right for me

[ALT VERSE]
know i'm gonna clear it see the reaper in my face 
why so fearful of the freedom of decisions, they a maze
fallen patterns tread in errant sinage
fucking fury conduits of violence
hide it hide it bitch

you ain't right you ain't right for me

coz i let you tread too thin i let them go it too far 
so in the past 
so sure of the 
 subduing mood



```
