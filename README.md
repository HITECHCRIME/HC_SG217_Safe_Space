## Lyrics

```
bruuuu
yaaaa

[CHORUS]
i'm sick and tired of this giving you my place (place)
remember when I made you promise to deflower better days 
of yours (yours) it's my space it's my space bitch, it's my space (blargh)

[VERSE]
know i'm gonna clear it, see the reaper in my face 
you so fearful of the freedom, all decisions they a maze
morbid pattern ties an errant thread in sinage conduits of violence
hide it hide it bitch

 fucking furious 

i've finally found it, feeling's up 
you're ain't right for me so i think i'll just let you out

[ALT VERSE]
know i'm gonna clear it see the reaper in my face 
why so fearful of the freedom of decisions, they a maze
fallen patterns tread in errant sinage
fucking fury conduits of violence
hide it hide it bitch

you ain't right you ain't right for me

coz i let you tread too thin i let them go it too far 
so in the past 
so sure of the 
 subduing mood

[CHORUS]
i'm sick and tired of this giving you my place (place)
remember when I made you promise to deflower better days 
of yours (yours) it's my space it's my space bitch, it's my space (blargh)

[CHORUS]
i'm sick and tired of this giving you my place (place)
remember when I made you promise to deflower better days 
of yours (yours) it's my space it's my space bitch, it's my space (blargh)
